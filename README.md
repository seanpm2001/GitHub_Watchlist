# Plans

This project will be automated with [@AUTOMATE-2001](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001/) and will showcase all my GitHub "watches". Each branch will have a different account of "watched" repositories, with about 2-4 accounts total. It will serve as a primary database of all my GitHub "watches".

Currently, a limited corpus of "watches" is available for use until the automation is done.

The automation will create a single file with every "watch" I have started and given, categorized by repository and account. It will also contain separate index files for each individual "watched" repository, which won't be sorted by accounts.
